Better version of a responsive web design, more details in a README file.


This is a small practice focused on some scroll animations which I find amazing. 
//index.html and register.html are pages that are full, the rest of them are empty.
      - it's an actual skeleton of a page 
      - personally i love simple design 
      - photos on the slideshow can have a better color contrast with the background to give a totally different feeling, but I used those where I have a free licence. 
      - signup form is very basic and some other stuff, but as I said, I focused on animations and interactivity. 
      - and the slideshow I did, is based solely on my knowledge of JS, with time and a bit of internet it will be a lot better. 
      - every aspect of this page would be better if there was an actual goal to achieve, but without any goals, i'm satisfied with
      animations, simple design and interactivity.
